1. Intro

OpenDataPlane implementation for Linux generic. Directory linux-generic contains ODP headers and implementation
for linux-generic target. This drop does not target high
performance. It is rather proof of ODP API functionality. It still uses
linux-generic's SW scheduler.

2. Build
# To compile ODP
./bootstrap
./configure
make
