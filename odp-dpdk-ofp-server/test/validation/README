To add tests in here, please observe the rules listed below. This list
is a brief overview, for a more detailed explanation of the test
framework refer to the ODP Implementers' Guide, which can built as
follows:

       ./configure --enable-user-guides
       make

Output will be in doc/output/. If this fails, check the documentation
section of the DEPENDENCIES file.

Rules for all tests under this tree:

1. Tests must be placed in the directory of the module they belong to.

2. Tests must be platform agnostic, i.e.

    - should be written in plain C only.
    - may only use C standard library functions, CUnit functions and of
      course ODP functions
    - should be expected to pass on all ODP implementations

   Tests that do not follow these rules should be placed in the platform
   specific test area (currently platform/<platform>/test/).

3. If a new ODP API module is created, please update the Makefile.am.

4. Symbols exported from test libraries must respect the naming
   convention detailed in the ODP Implementers' Guide.
