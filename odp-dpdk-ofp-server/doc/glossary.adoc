worker thread::
    A worker is a type of ODP thread. It will usually be isolated from
    the scheduling of any host operating system and is intended for fast-path
    processing with a low and predictable latency. Worker threads will not
    generally receive interrupts and will run to completion.
control thread::
    A control thread is a type of ODP thread. It will be isolated from the host
    operating system house keeping tasks but will be scheduled by it and may
    receive interrupts.
ODP instantiation process::
    The process calling `odp_init_global()`, which is probably the
    first process which is started when an ODP application is started.
    There is one single such process per ODP instantiation.
thread::
    The word thread (without any further specification) refers to an ODP
    thread.
ODP thread::
    An ODP thread is a flow of execution that belongs to ODP:
    Any "flow of execution" (i.e. OS process or OS thread) calling
    `odp_init_global()`, or `odp_init_local()` becomes an ODP thread.
    This definition currently limits the number of ODP instances on a given
    machine to one. In the future `odp_init_global()` will return something
    like an ODP instance reference and `odp_init_local()` will take such
    a reference in parameter, allowing threads to join any running ODP instance.
    Note that, in a Linux environment an ODP thread can be either a Linux
    process or a linux thread (i.e. a linux process calling `odp_init_local()`
    will be referred as ODP thread, not ODP process).
event::
    An event is a notification that can be placed in a queue.
queue::
    A communication channel that holds events
