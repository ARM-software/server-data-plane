== PktIO Processing
Before packets can be manipulated they typically need to be _received_ and
after they are manipulated they need to be _transmitted_. The ODP abstraction
that captures these operations is the *Packet I/O (PktIO)*.
PktIOs are represented by handles of type *odp_pktio_t* and
represent a logical I/O interface that is mapped in an implementation-defined
manner to an underlying integrated I/O adapter or NIC.

PktIO objects are manipulated through various state transitions via
`odp_pktio_xxx()` API calls as shown below:

.ODP PktIO Finite State Machine
image::../images/pktio_fsm.svg[align="center"]

PktIOs begin in the *Unallocated* state. From here a call `odp_pktio_open()`
is used to create an *odp_pktio_t* handle that is used in all subsequent calls
to manipulate the object. This call puts the PktIO into the *Unconfigured*
state. To become operational, a PktIO must first be
*configured* for Input, Output, or both Input and Output via the
`odp_pktin_queue_config()` and/or `odp_pktout_queue_config()` APIs, and then
*started* via the `odp_pktio_start()` to make it *Ready*.

Following the completion of I/O processing, the `odp_pktio_stop()` API returns
the PktIO to the *Configured* state. From here it may be *Reconfigured* via
additional `odp_pktin_queue_config()` and/or `odp_pktout_queue_config()` calls,
or *Closed* via the `odp_pktio_close()` API to return the PktIO to the
*Unallocated* state.

=== PktIO Allocation
PktIO objects begin life by being _opened_ via the call:
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Open a packet IO interface
 *
 * An ODP program can open a single packet IO interface per device, attempts
 * to open an already open device will fail, returning ODP_PKTIO_INVALID with
 * errno set. Use odp_pktio_lookup() to obtain a handle to an already open
 * device. Packet IO parameters provide interface level configuration options.
 *
 * Packet input queue configuration must be setup with
 * odp_pktin_queue_config() before odp_pktio_start() is called. When packet
 * input mode is ODP_PKTIN_MODE_DISABLED, odp_pktin_queue_config() call is
 * optional and will ignore all parameters.
 *
 * Packet output queue configuration must be setup with
 * odp_pktout_queue_config() before odp_pktio_start() is called. When packet
 * output mode is ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_DISABLED or ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_TM,
 * odp_pktout_queue_config() call is optional and will ignore all parameters.
 *
 * Packet receive and transmit on the interface is enabled with a call to
 * odp_pktio_start(). If not specified otherwise, any interface level
 * configuration must not be changed when the interface is active (between start
 * and stop calls).
 *
 * In summary, a typical pktio interface setup sequence is ...
 *   * odp_pktio_open()
 *   * odp_pktin_queue_config()
 *   * odp_pktout_queue_config()
 *   * odp_pktio_start()
 *
 * ... and tear down sequence is:
 *   * odp_pktio_stop()
 *   * odp_pktio_close()
 *
 * @param name   Packet IO device name
 * @param pool   Default pool from which to allocate storage for packets
 *               received over this interface, must be of type ODP_POOL_PACKET
 * @param param  Packet IO parameters
 *
 * @return Packet IO handle
 * @retval ODP_PKTIO_INVALID on failure
 *
 * @note The device name "loop" is a reserved name for a loopback device used
 *	 for testing purposes.
 *
 * @note Packets arriving via this interface assigned to a CoS by the
 *	 classifier are received into the pool associated with that CoS. This
 *	 will occur either because this pktio is assigned a default CoS via
 *	 the odp_pktio_default_cos_set() routine, or because a matching PMR
 *	 assigned the packet to a specific CoS. The default pool specified
 *	 here is applicable only for those packets that are not assigned to a
 *	 more specific CoS.
 *
 * @see odp_pktio_start(), odp_pktio_stop(), odp_pktio_close()
 */
odp_pktio_t odp_pktio_open(const char *name, odp_pool_t pool,
                           const odp_pktio_param_t *param);
-----
`odp_pktio_open()` takes three arguments: a *name*, which is an
implementation-defined string that identifies the logical interface to be
opened, a *pool* that identifies the ODP pool that storage for received
packets should be allocated from, and a *param* structure that specifies
I/O options to be associated with this PktIO instance.
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Packet IO parameters
 *
 * In minimum, user must select input and output modes. Use 0 for defaults.
 * Initialize entire struct with zero to maintain API compatibility.
 */
typedef struct odp_pktio_param_t {
	/** Packet input mode
	  *
	  * The default value is ODP_PKTIN_MODE_DIRECT. */
	odp_pktin_mode_t in_mode;
	/** Packet output mode
	  *
	  * The default value is ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_DIRECT. */
	odp_pktout_mode_t out_mode;
} odp_pktio_param_t;
-----
ODP defines *"loop"* as a reserved name to indicate that this PktIO represents
a loopback interface. Loopback interfaces are useful as a means of recycling
packets back for reclassification after decryption or decapsulation, as well as
for diagnostic or testing purposes. For example, when receiving IPSEC traffic,
the classifier is able to recognize that the traffic is IPSEC, however until
the traffic is decrypted it is unable to say what that traffic contains.
So following decryption, sending the decrypted packet back to a loopback
interface allows the classifier to take a "second look" at the packet and
properly classify the decrypted payload. Similar considerations apply to
tunneled packets that must first be decapsulated to reveal the true payload.

The *pool* specifies the default pool to
use for packet allocation if not overridden by the classifier due to a
specific or default Class-of-Service (CoS) match on the packet. The *param*
struct, in turn, specifies the input and output *modes* of the PktIO.

=== PktIO Input and Output Modes
PktIO objects support four different Input and Output modes, that may be
specified independently at *open* time.

.PktIO Input Modes
* `ODP_PKTIN_MODE_DIRECT`
* `ODP_PKTIN_MODE_QUEUE`
* `ODP_OKTIN_MODE_SCHED`
* `ODP_PKTIN_MODE_DISABLED`

.PktIO Output Modes
* `ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_DIRECT`
* `ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_QUEUE`
* `ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_TM`
* `ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_DISABLED`

The DISABLED modes indicate that either input or output is prohibited on this
PktIO. Attempts to receive packets on a PktIO whose `in_mode` is DISABLED
return no packets while packets sent to a PktIO whose `out_mode` is DISABLED
are discarded.

==== Direct I/O Modes
DIRECT I/O is the default mode for PktIO objects. It is designed to support
poll-based packet processing, which is often found in legacy applications
being ported to ODP, and can also be a preferred mode for some types of
packet processing. By supporting poll-based I/O processing, ODP provides
maximum flexibility to the data plane application writer.

===== Direct RX Processing
The processing of DIRECT input is shown below:

.PktIO DIRECT Mode Receive Processing
image::../images/pktin_direct_recv.svg[align="center"]

In DIRECT mode, received packets are stored in one or more special PktIO queues
of type *odp_pktin_queue_t* and are retrieved by threads calling the
`odp_pktin_recv()` API.

Once opened, setting up a DIRECT mode PktIO is performed by the
`odp_pktin_queue_config()` API.
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Configure packet input queues
 *
 * Setup a number of packet input queues and configure those. The maximum number
 * of queues is platform dependent and can be queried with
 * odp_pktio_capability(). Use odp_pktin_queue_param_init() to initialize
 * parameters into their default values. Default values are also used when
 * 'param' pointer is NULL.
 *
 * Queue handles for input queues can be requested with odp_pktin_queue() or
 * odp_pktin_event_queue() after this call. All requested queues are setup on
 * success, no queues are setup on failure. Each call reconfigures input queues
 * and may invalidate all previous queue handles.
 *
 * @param pktio    Packet IO handle
 * @param param    Packet input queue configuration parameters. Uses defaults
 *                 when NULL.
 *
 * @retval 0 on success
 * @retval <0 on failure
 *
 * @see odp_pktio_capability(), odp_pktin_queue(), odp_pktin_event_queue()
 */
int odp_pktin_queue_config(odp_pktio_t pktio,
			   const odp_pktin_queue_param_t *param);
-----
The second argument to this call is the *odp_pktin_queue_param_t*
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Packet input queue parameters
 */
typedef struct odp_pktin_queue_param_t {
	/** Operation mode
	  *
	  * The default value is ODP_PKTIO_OP_MT. Application may enable
	  * performance optimization by defining ODP_PKTIO_OP_MT_UNSAFE when
	  * applicable. */
	odp_pktio_op_mode_t op_mode;

	/** Enable flow hashing
	  * 0: Do not hash flows
	  * 1: Hash flows to input queues */
	odp_bool_t hash_enable;

	/** Protocol field selection for hashing. Multiple protocols can be
	  * selected. */
	odp_pktin_hash_proto_t hash_proto;

	/** Number of input queues to be created. More than one input queue
	  * require input hashing or classifier setup. Hash_proto is ignored
	  * when hash_enable is zero or num_queues is one. This value must be
	  * between 1 and interface capability. Queue type is defined by the
	  * input mode. The default value is 1. */
	unsigned num_queues;

	/** Queue parameters for creating input queues in ODP_PKTIN_MODE_QUEUE
	  * or ODP_PKTIN_MODE_SCHED modes. Scheduler parameters are considered
	  * only in ODP_PKTIN_MODE_SCHED mode. */
	odp_queue_param_t queue_param;

} odp_pktin_queue_param_t;
-----
Note that the *queue_param* field of this struct is ignored in DIRECT mode.
The purpose of `odp_pktin_queue_config()` is to specify the number of PktIn
queues to be created and to set their attributes.

It is important to note that while `odp_pktio_queue_config()` creates a
requested number of RX queues that are associated with the PktIO and accepts
optimization advice as to how the application intends to use them, _i.e._,
whether the queues need to be safe for concurrent use by multiple threads
(OP_MT) or only one thread at a time (OP_MT_UNSAFE), these queues are *not*
associated with any specific thread. Applications use a discipline
appropriate to their design, which may involve restricting PktIn queue use
to separate threads, but that is an aspect of the application design. ODP
simply provides a set of tools here, but it is the application that determines
how those tools are used.

===== Hash Processing
Another feature of DIRECT mode input is the provision of a *hash* function  used
to distribute incoming packets among the PktIO's PktIn queues. If the
`hash_enable` field of the *odp_pktin_queue_param_t* is 1,
then the `hash_proto` field is used to specify which field(s) of incoming
packets should be used as input to an implementation-defined packet
distribution hash function.
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Packet input hash protocols
 *
 * The list of protocol header field combinations, which are included into
 * packet input hash calculation.
 */
typedef union odp_pktin_hash_proto_t {
	/** Protocol header fields for hashing */
	struct {
		/** IPv4 addresses and UDP port numbers */
		uint32_t ipv4_udp : 1;
		/** IPv4 addresses and TCP port numbers */
		uint32_t ipv4_tcp : 1;
		/** IPv4 addresses */
		uint32_t ipv4     : 1;
		/** IPv6 addresses and UDP port numbers */
		uint32_t ipv6_udp : 1;
		/** IPv6 addresses and TCP port numbers */
		uint32_t ipv6_tcp : 1;
		/** IPv6 addresses */
		uint32_t ipv6     : 1;
	} proto;

	/** All bits of the bit field structure */
	uint32_t all_bits;
} odp_pktin_hash_proto_t;
-----
Note that the hash function used in PktIO poll mode operation is intended to
provide simple packet distribution among multiple PktIn queues associated with
the PktIO. It does not have the sophistication of the *ODP Classifier*, however
it also does not incur the setup requirements of pattern matching rules,
making it a simpler choice for less sophisticated applications. Note that
ODP does not specify how the hash is to be performed. That is left to each
implementation. The hash only specifies which input packet fields are of
interest to the application and should be considered by the hash function in
deciding how to distribute packets among PktIn queues. The only expectation
is that packets that have the same hash values should all be mapped to the
same PktIn queue.

===== PktIn Queues
A *PktIn Queue* is a special type of queue that is used internally by PktIOs
operating in DIRECT mode. Applications cannot perform enqueues to these queues,
however they may obtain references to them via the `odp_pktin_queue()` API
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Direct packet input queues
 *
 * Returns the number of input queues configured for the interface in
 * ODP_PKTIN_MODE_DIRECT mode. Outputs up to 'num' queue handles when the
 * 'queues' array pointer is not NULL. If return value is larger than 'num',
 * there are more queues than the function was allowed to output. If return
 * value (N) is less than 'num', only queues[0 ... N-1] have been written.
 *
 * Packets from these queues are received with odp_pktin_recv().
 *
 * @param      pktio    Packet IO handle
 * @param[out] queues   Points to an array of queue handles for output
 * @param      num      Maximum number of queue handles to output
 *
 * @return Number of packet input queues
 * @retval <0 on failure
 */
int odp_pktin_queue(odp_pktio_t pktio, odp_pktin_queue_t queues[], int num);
-----
Once configured, prior to receiving packets the PktIO must be placed into the
*Ready* state via a call to `odp_pktio_start()`
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Start packet receive and transmit
 *
 * Activate packet receive and transmit on a previously opened or stopped
 * interface. The interface can be stopped with a call to odp_pktio_stop().
 *
 * @param pktio  Packet IO handle
 *
 * @retval 0 on success
 * @retval <0 on failure
 *
 * @see odp_pktio_open(), odp_pktio_stop()
 */
int odp_pktio_start(odp_pktio_t pktio);
-----
Once started, the PktIn queue handles are used as arguments to
`odp_pktin_recv()` to receive packets from the PktIO.
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Receive packets directly from an interface input queue
 *
 * Receives up to 'num' packets from the pktio interface input queue. When
 * input queue parameter 'op_mode' has been set to ODP_PKTIO_OP_MT_UNSAFE,
 * the operation is optimized for single thread operation per queue and the same
 * queue must not be accessed simultaneously from multiple threads.
 *
 * @param      queue      Packet input queue handle for receiving packets
 * @param[out] packets[]  Packet handle array for output of received packets
 * @param      num        Maximum number of packets to receive
 *
 * @return Number of packets received
 * @retval <0 on failure
 *
 * @see odp_pktin_queue()
 */
int odp_pktin_recv(odp_pktin_queue_t queue, odp_packet_t packets[], int num);
-----
Note that it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that PktIn queues
are used correctly. For example, it is an error for multiple threads to
attempt to perform concurrent receive processing on the same PktIn queue
if that queue has been marked MT_UNSAFE. Performance MAY be improved if
the application observes the discipline of associating each PktIn queue
with a single RX thread (in which case the PktIn queue can be marked
MT_UNSAFE), however this is up to the application to determine how best
to structure itself.

===== Direct TX Processing
A PktIO operating in DIRECT mode performs TX processing as shown here:

.PktIO DIRECT Mode Transmit Processing
image::../images/pktout_direct_send.svg[align="center"]

Direct TX processing operates similarly to Direct RX processing. Following
open, the `odp_pktout_queue_config()` API is used to create and configure
one or more *PktOut queues* to be used to support packet transmission by
this PktIO
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Configure packet output queues
 *
 * Setup a number of packet output queues and configure those. The maximum
 * number of queues is platform dependent and can be queried with
 * odp_pktio_capability(). Use odp_pktout_queue_param_init() to initialize
 * parameters into their default values. Default values are also used when
 * 'param' pointer is NULL.
 *
 * Queue handles for output queues can be requested with odp_pktout_queue() or
 * odp_pktout_event_queue() after this call. All requested queues are setup on
 * success, no queues are setup on failure. Each call reconfigures output queues
 * and may invalidate all previous queue handles.
 *
 * @param pktio    Packet IO handle
 * @param param    Packet output queue configuration parameters. Uses defaults
 *                 when NULL.
 *
 * @retval 0 on success
 * @retval <0 on failure
 *
 * @see odp_pktio_capability(), odp_pktout_queue(), odp_pktout_event_queue()
 */
int odp_pktout_queue_config(odp_pktio_t pktio,
			    const odp_pktout_queue_param_t *param);
-----
As with `odp_pktin_queue_config()`, the configuration of PktOut queues
involves the use of a parameter struct:
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Packet output queue parameters
 *
 * These parameters are used in ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_DIRECT and
 * ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_QUEUE modes.
 */
typedef struct odp_pktout_queue_param_t {
	/** Operation mode
	  *
	  * The default value is ODP_PKTIO_OP_MT. Application may enable
	  * performance optimization by defining ODP_PKTIO_OP_MT_UNSAFE when
	  * applicable. */
	odp_pktio_op_mode_t op_mode;

	/** Number of output queues to be created. The value must be between
	  * 1 and interface capability. The default value is 1. */
	unsigned num_queues;

} odp_pktout_queue_param_t;
-----
As with direct input, direct output uses one or more special output queues
of type *odp_pktout_queue_t* that are created and configured by this call.

As with PktIn queues, the handles for these created PktOut queues may be
retrieved by the `odp_pktout_queue()` API:
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Direct packet output queues
 *
 * Returns the number of output queues configured for the interface in
 * ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_DIRECT mode. Outputs up to 'num' queue handles when the
 * 'queues' array pointer is not NULL. If return value is larger than 'num',
 * there are more queues than the function was allowed to output. If return
 * value (N) is less than 'num', only queues[0 ... N-1] have been written.
 *
 * Packets are sent to these queues with odp_pktout_send().
 *
 * @param      pktio    Packet IO handle
 * @param[out] queues   Points to an array of queue handles for output
 * @param      num      Maximum number of queue handles to output
 *
 * @return Number of packet output queues
 * @retval <0 on failure
 */
int odp_pktout_queue(odp_pktio_t pktio, odp_pktout_queue_t queues[], int num);
-----
Once the PktIO has been configured for output and started via
`odp_pktio_start()`, packets may be transmitted to the PktIO by calling
`odp_pktout_send()`:
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Send packets directly to an interface output queue
 *
 * Sends out a number of packets to the interface output queue. When
 * output queue parameter 'op_mode' has been set to ODP_PKTIO_OP_MT_UNSAFE,
 * the operation is optimized for single thread operation per queue and the same
 * queue must not be accessed simultaneously from multiple threads.
 *
 * A successful call returns the actual number of packets sent. If return value
 * is less than 'num', the remaining packets at the end of packets[] array
 * are not consumed, and the caller has to take care of them.
 *
 * @param queue        Packet output queue handle for sending packets
 * @param packets[]    Array of packets to send
 * @param num          Number of packets to send
 *
 * @return Number of packets sent
 * @retval <0 on failure
 */
int odp_pktout_send(odp_pktout_queue_t queue, odp_packet_t packets[], int num);
-----
Note that the argument to this call specifies the PktOut queue that the
packet is to be added to rather than the PktIO itself. This permits multiple
threads (presumably operating on different cores) a more efficient means of
separating I/O processing destined for the same interface.

==== Queued I/O Modes
To provide additional flexibility when operating in poll mode, PktIOs may also
be opened in QUEUE Mode. The difference between DIRECT and QUEUE mode is that
QUEUE mode uses standard ODP event queues to service packets.

===== Queue RX Processing
The processing for QUEUE input processing is shown below:

.PktIO QUEUE Mode Receive Processing
image::../images/pktin_queue_recv.svg[align="center"]

In QUEUE mode, received packets are stored in one or more standard ODP queues.
The difference is that these queues are not created directly by the
application. Instead, they are created in response to an
`odp_pktin_queue_config()` call.

As with DIRECT mode, the `odp_pktin_queue_param_t` specified to this call
indicates whether an input hash should be used and if so which field(s) of
the packet should be considered as input to the has function.

The main difference between DIRECT and QUEUE RX processing is that because
the PktIO uses standard ODP event queues, other parts of the application can
use `odp_queue_enq()` API calls to enqueue packets to these queues for
"RX" processing in addition to those originating from the PktIO interface
itself. To obtain the handles of these input queues, the
`odp_pktin_event_queue()` API is used:
[source,c]
-----
/**
 * Event queues for packet input
 *
 * Returns the number of input queues configured for the interface in
 * ODP_PKTIN_MODE_QUEUE and ODP_PKTIN_MODE_SCHED modes. Outputs up to 'num'
 * queue handles when the 'queues' array pointer is not NULL. If return value is
 * larger than 'num', there are more queues than the function was allowed to
 * output. If return value (N) is less than 'num', only queues[0 ... N-1] have
 * been written.
 *
 * Packets (and other events) from these queues are received with
 * odp_queue_deq(), odp_schedule(), etc calls.
 *
 * @param      pktio    Packet IO handle
 * @param[out] queues   Points to an array of queue handles for output
 * @param      num      Maximum number of queue handles to output
 *
 * @return Number of packet input queues
 * @retval <0 on failure
 */
int odp_pktin_event_queue(odp_pktio_t pktio, odp_queue_t queues[], int num);
-----
Similarly, threads receive packets from PktIOs operating in QUEUE mode by
making standard `odp_queue_deq()` calls to one of the event queues associated
with the PktIO.

===== Queue TX Processing
Transmit processing for PktIOs operating in QUEUE mode is shown below:

.PktIO QUEUE Mode Transmit Processing
image::../images/pktout_queue_send.svg[align="center]

For TX processing QUEUE mode behaves similar to DIRECT mode except that
output queues are regular ODP event queues that receive packets via
`odp_queue_enq()` calls rather than special PktOut queues that use
`odp_pktout_send()`. Again, these queues are created via a call to
`odp_pktout_queue_config()` following `odp_pktio_open()`.

The main reason for selecting QUEUE mode for output is flexibility. If an
application is designed to use a _pipeline model_ where packets flow through
a series of processing stages via queues, then having the PktIO in QUEUE
mode means that the application can always use the same enq APIs to pass packets
from one stage to the next, including the final transmit output stage.

==== Scheduled I/O Modes
The final PktIO mode supported integrates RX and TX processing with the ODP
_event model_.  For RX processing this involves the use of the *Scheduler*
while for TX processing this involves the use of the *Traffic Manager*.

Scheduled RX Processing is further divided based on whether or not the
Classifier is used.

===== Scheduled RX Processing
When a PktIO is opened with `ODP_PKTIN_MODE_SCHED`, it indicates that the
input queues created by a subsequent `odp_pktin_queue_config()` call are to
be used as input to the *ODP Scheduler*.

.PktIO SCHED Mode Receive Processing
image::../images/pktin_sched_recv.svg[align="center']

For basic use, SCHED mode simply associates the PktIO input event queues
created by `odp_pktin_queue_config()` with the scheduler. Hashing may still be
employed to distribute input packets among multiple input queues. However
instead of these being plain queues they are scheduled queues and have
associated scheduling attributes like priority, scheduler group, and
synchronization mode (parallel, atomic, ordered). SCHED mode thus provides
both packet distribution (via the optional hash) as well as scalability via
the ODP event model.

In its fullest form, PktIOs operating in SCHED mode use the *ODP Classifier*
to permit fine-grained flow separation on *Class of Service (CoS)* boundaries.

.PktIO SCHED Mode Receive Processing with Classification
image::../images/pktin_sched_cls.svg[align="center"]

In this mode of operation, the hash function of `odp_pktin_queue_config()` is
typically not used. Instead, the event queues created by this call,
as well as any additional event queues created via separate
`odp_queue_create()` calls are associated with classes of service via
`odp_cls_cos_create()` calls. Classification is enabled for the PktIO as a
whole by assigning a _default_ CoS via the `odp_pktio_default_cos_set()`
API.

When operating in SCHED mode, applications do not call PktIn receive functions.
Instead the PktIn queues are scanned by the scheduler and, if classification
is enabled on the PktIO, inbound packets are classified and put on queues
associated with their target class of service which are themelves scheduled
to threads. Note that on platforms that support hardware classification
and/or scheduling these operations will typically be performed in parallel as
packets are arriving, so this description refers to the _logical_ sequence
of classification and scheduling, and does not imply that this is a serial
process.

===== Scheduled TX Processing
Scheduled transmit processing is performed via the *ODP Traffic Manager* and
is requested when a PktIO is opened with an `out_mode` of `ODP_PKTOUT_MODE_TM`.

For TX processing via the Traffic Manager, applications use the `odp_tm_enq()`
API:
[source,c]
-----
/** The odp_tm_enq() function is used to add packets to a given TM system.
 * Note that the System Metadata associated with the pkt needed by the TM
 * system is (a) a drop_eligible bit, (b) a two bit "pkt_color", (c) a 16-bit
 * pkt_len, and MAYBE? (d) a signed 8-bit shaper_len_adjust.
 *
 * If there is a non-zero shaper_len_adjust, then it is added to the pkt_len
 * after any non-zero shaper_len_adjust that is part of the shaper profile.
 *
 * The pkt_color bits are a result of some earlier Metering/Marking/Policing
 * processing (typically ingress based), and should not be confused with the
 * shaper_color produced from the TM shaper entities within the tm_inputs and
 * tm_nodes.
 *
 * @param[in] tm_queue  Specifies the tm_queue (and indirectly the TM system).
 * @param[in] pkt       Handle to a packet.
 * @return              Returns 0 upon success, < 0 upon failure. One of the
 *                      more common failure reasons is WRED dropage.
 */
int odp_tm_enq(odp_tm_queue_t tm_queue, odp_packet_t pkt);

See the *Traffic Manager* section of this document for full information about
Traffic Manager configuration and operation.
