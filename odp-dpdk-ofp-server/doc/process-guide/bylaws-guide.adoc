Abstract
--------
This document is intended to guide a new application developer in
understanding the by-laws.

The ODP project has established a set of by-laws defining the operational
processes by which direction of ODP resources is determined and how the product
is managed.

The by-laws define roles, stewardship/management, patch approvals, voting
procedures, and reporting (Roadmap) requirements.

Further details about ODP may be found at the http://opendataplane.org[ODP]
home page.

== Roles considered
=== Users
People that use the project and submit bugs and request new features to the
project.

=== Contributors
All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code, documentation, or
resources to the project. A contributor that makes sustained, welcome
contributions to the project may be invited to become a maintainer, though the
exact timing of such invitations depends on many factors.

If a contributor wants to move the project in direction X or add feature Y, and
that requires a lot of rewrite in the existing code-base then:

* explain that in an email to the mailing list.
* send out RFCs (early and often) with example code, so the community (and
maintainers) can see what you want and say if it fits or not.

The above helps find and solve common problems among contributors.

=== Maintainer(s)
* The maintainer for a project have push rights to the main repo. Only one
maintainer. The most trustworthy sub-maintainer shall step in and take over the
maintainer ship as required.
* Sub-maintainer(s) one or many for the different modules in the project.
* Sub-maintainers shall focus on ensuring that the current code base has good
quality and review new patches to maintain that good quality.
* When Maintainers accept code, they have to deal with it until they die or rip
it out (so its important that they understand what the code does and why they
need it). The contributor shall convince the maintainer to take their code (the
maintainer should feel like he would be stupid to not accept the code)

=== Release Manager ===

* The RM shall publish a Release Plan on the roadmap. One week before the
release the candidate list will be reviewed.
* The RM is responsible for building consensus around the content of the
Release.

== Roadmap
The roadmap shall state projected future releases and the expected content.

== Steering Committee (SC)
* Defining the requirements for the project's shared resources, email
  lists and the homepage.
* Speaking on behalf of the project.
* Resolving license disputes regarding products of the project.
* Nominating new PMC members and committers.
* Maintaining these by-laws and other guidelines of the project.
* Planning the roadmap (shall state projected future releases and the expected
content).

=== Patch approval
Reviewed-by is only replied to the list after inspecting the code. If you have
review comments they should be constructive and not just saying "no".
Reviewed-by and Signed-off-by implies that you are co-responsible for any bugs
found in the code.

If you don't respond you are assumed to agree with the patch.

== Voting ==
Voting is necessary if consensus not has been reached. Must have established
quorum.

* "Yes", "Agree","+1"	the action should be performed.
In general, this vote also indicates a willingness on the behalf of the voter in
"making it happen"

* "Abstain"	This vote indicates that the voter abstains.
The voter has no interest or does not participate in the vote.

* "No", "Disagree" "-1"	the action should not be performed.
On issues where consensus is required, this vote counts as a veto. All vetoes
must contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetoes with no
explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a -1 vote to include an
alternative course of action.

== Adding new features ==

If person X adds a new feature (API group X) then he should/could be asked to
be the maintainer for that feature. Code (old or new) is likely to be removed
if it is unmaintained.
